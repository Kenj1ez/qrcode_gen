Simple QRcode generator

first get the "qrcode" module for you pyhton using 'pip install qrcode'
also get "pillow" module using 'pip install pillow'

import and check if the qr code module is working.

if you get an error saying "import "qrcode" could not be resolved from source pylance" dont worry all you have to do is change to interpreter to python global, if using a virtual environment then choose python from the scripts folder of the venv.

you are all set, just copy the code or make yourself a new one :)


This is my first github repository. If there are mistakes please forgive me as I started learning python very recently :)
Have a good day.
